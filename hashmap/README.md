# HashMap

A Hash Table (Hash Map) is a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A Hash Table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. (From Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table]
