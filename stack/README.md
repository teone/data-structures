# Stack

A Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. The order in which elements come off a Stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (for last in, first out). (From Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)]
