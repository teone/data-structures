# Array

An Array data structure, or simply an Array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array. (From Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure]
